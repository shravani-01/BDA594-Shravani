**Big data** is a collection of large sets of real world data and involves the efficient ways to manage, process and analyse the data using various big data tools thereby eliminating the limitations of the traditional database management techniques. Terabytes of data is collected from various business sectors including industries, hospitals, corporate companies, satellites and so on.  

These data is then being processed to filter out the true data by cleaning. The data is then used for analysis by performing visualizations or trained using ML algorithms depending on the usecase.
